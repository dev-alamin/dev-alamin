## About Me
I focus on the engineering side of WordPress—building scalable, secure, and performance-driven systems rather than relying on page builders. My work includes contributing to **enterprise-grade plugins at rtCamp** and designing custom, database-driven applications like Entries Manager.

I also build **headless WordPress architectures**, using the REST API to power modern frontend experiences with **React and Next.js**. This allows me to combine WordPress’s robust content management capabilities with fast, flexible, and maintainable frontend applications.

Across my work, I emphasize clean **OOP PHP design, WP-CLI automation, secure coding standards, and API-first** development to deliver solutions that are reliable, extensible, and production-ready.
